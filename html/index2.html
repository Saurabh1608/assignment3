          Because of their beautiful history which includes 58 titles in total,including 18 English League Titles,11 Fa Cups,4 League cup,3 European Cups..
          
          Because of the style of play in which they play which include counter attacking football,winning football,a solid defence,Wing Play,which i love about the beautiful game and think that these charecteristics can win us football and also show us an entertaining game every time a team plays with it..
          
          Because of the type of staff we have who give their 100% for the club and always intend in winning us a game and all the trophies we compete to win..And Because of the type of support our club gets, and because our fans really give their 100% devotion for the club and always are supporting our club,whatever circumstances..
